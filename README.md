  The contents of this zip file should be to same folder where the controllers CURRENT firmware 'Host Tools' support files were extracted. This folder is the one with the gw.py or gw.exe file in it.
  If you run GreaseweazleGUI from a folder that contains a different Host Tools distribution than the controllers currently burned firmware, there will be issues.

  The baseline diskdef*.cfg files will be included with this release and may not be current. It will be necessary for each end-user to keep these files up to date. They can be downloaded from https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle/tree/master/src/greaseweazle/data

  Prior releases attempted to prevent invalid command lines from being selected from the GUI.  As Host Tool formats change frequently it has become difficult to continue that policy ongoing.

  This is a work in progress.
